## Jupyter Notifier
**Jupyter Notifier** is a browser extension that notifies you when code cells terminate.

## Description
On every Jupyter Notebook environment, Jupyter Notifier allows you to select specific cells for notification. For this, Jupyter Notifier injects a button ![bell](./src/assets/icons/notifications-black-24dp.svg) into your notebook. You can get notified with a sound, a message, or both when code cells terminate. 

With Jupyter Notifier, you won't be repeatedly checking whether your cell has finished running.

## Installation
**Jupyter Notifier** can be installed through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chjgkagmoifencbeboghhaefjknfogib/) and will be available for Firefox soon.

On termination of a subscribed cell, given 'Notify me with a **message**' is activated, you'll get a notification containing the runtime of the cell.
